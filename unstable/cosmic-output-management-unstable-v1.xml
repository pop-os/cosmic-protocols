  <description summary="extension protocol to wlr-output-management">
    This protocol serves as an extension to wlr-output-management.

    It primarily adds explicit output mirroring,
    while upstream is figuring out how to best support that.

    It was designed against version 4 of wlr-output-management, but tries
    it's best to be forward compatible.

            As soon as the extended output is created, events will be dispatched with an accompanying

            Any further updates will produce new events, if properties of the zcosmic_output_head_v1 change,
            just like for the original `zwlr_output_head_v1`. Events should be handled as atomic, as denoted
            by `zwlr_output_manager_v1::done`.

            Trying to create more than one zcosmic_output_head_v1 per zwlr_output_head_v1 will raise an

        This request creates a head configuration object that can be used to change the head's properties.

        This is an alternative to `zwlr_output_configuration_v1::enable_head` or `zwlr_output_configuration_v1::disable_head`
        Using either with the same `head` argument will result in an `already_configured_head` error on the original

        All properties are still required to be set to the resulting `zwlr_output_configuration_head` by the client
        as denoted in the original protocol. Some like `set_position` however might be ignored in mirroring configurations.

        Trying to set a disabled or mirroring head as `mirroring` or calling `disable_head`/`mirror_head` after using a head
        as a `mirroring` argument will raise a `mirrored_head_busy` protocol error.
