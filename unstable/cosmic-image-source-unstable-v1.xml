  <description summary="opaque image source objects">
    This protocol serves as an intermediary between screen capturing protocols
    and potential image sources such as outputs and toplevels.

    This protocol may be extended to support more image sources in the future,
    thereby adding those image sources to other protocols that use the image
    source object without having to modify those protocols.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
    phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
    corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can
    only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.

    <description summary="opaque image source object">
      The image source object is an opaque descriptor for a capturable resource.
      This resource may be any sort of entity from which an image may be
      derived.

      Note, because zcosmic_image_source_v1 objects are created from multiple
      independent factory interfaces, the zcosmic_image_source_v1 interface is
      frozen at version 1.
