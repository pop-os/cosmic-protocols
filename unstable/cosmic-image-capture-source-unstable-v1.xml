  <description summary="opaque image source objects">
    This protocol serves as an intermediary between screen capturing protocols
    and potential image sources such as outputs and toplevels.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
    phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
    corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can
    only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.
