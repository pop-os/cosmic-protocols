    <description summary="a workspace handing a group of surfaces">
      A zcosmic_workspace_handle_v2 object represents a a workspace that handles a
      group of surfaces.

      Each workspace has a name, conveyed to the client with the name event; a
      list of states, conveyed to the client with the state event; and
      optionally a set of coordinates, conveyed to the client with the
      coordinates event. The client may request that the compositor activate or
      deactivate the workspace.

      Each workspace can belong to only a single workspace group.
      Depepending on the compositor policy, there might be workspaces with
      the same name in different workspace groups, but these workspaces are still
      separate (e.g. one of them might be active while the other is not).

    <event name="capabilities">
      <description summary="compositor capabilities">
        This event advertises the capabilities supported by the compositor. If
        a capability isn't supported, clients should hide or disable the UI
        elements that expose this functionality. For instance, if the
        compositor doesn't advertise support for removing workspaces, a button
        triggering the remove request should not be displayed.

        The compositor will ignore requests it doesn't support. For instance,
        a compositor which doesn't advertise support for remove will ignore
        remove requests.

        Compositors must send this event once after creation of a
        `zcosmic_workspace_handle_v2`. When the capabilities change, compositors
        must send this event again.
