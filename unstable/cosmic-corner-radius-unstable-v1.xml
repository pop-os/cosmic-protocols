  <description summary="communicate corner radius of windows">
    This protocol provides a way for clients to communicate the
    corner radius of their toplevels, should they use rounded corners.

    This hint can then be used by the compositor to draw fitting outlines
    or prevent overdrawing of other server-side drawn interfaces.
